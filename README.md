# Anniversary Site, A React+Redux WordPress theme
WordPress theme built with react calling WP-API for content. Based on [jackreichert's theme](https://github.com/jackreichert/a-wp-react-redux-theme
)

## Why?
We wanted a site that could be nagivated without losing state. There aren't many WordPress themes that do that, so we built one from Jack's React/Redux bootstrap.

## How do I run Webpack?
- run `npm install`, or `yarn`
- run `webpack` or `webpack -p` (to minify)
